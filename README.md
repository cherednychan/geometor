# codename "geometor"
This is a repo for geometry calculator on Python. 
The calculator can calculate the area and perimeter of one of the shapes: Square, Rectangle, Circle and Triangle.
For calculating the results for Square it uses only the lentgh of one side. 
Circle is similar to Square - it uses just the radius.
Rectangle uses the coordinates of top-right and bottom-left points.
Triangle uses the coordinates of all three points to calculate the sides. From there it calculates the perimeter and the area. The area is found with Heron's formula.
If the input is none of the above shapes - the program asks to try again.
